### Summary
I love an active lifestyle. I studied choreography and sang in the choir.
Six years of swimming have developed the habit of reaching the intended goal, despite physical or moral fatigue. The skill of stress resistance and teamwork was developed during the course of military training. I have very good communication skills, proven in my previous jobs. Besides I deal with copywriting for fashion and films news sites.

When I have free time, I like to draw, to sculpt, or to do something with my hands. I always try to learn something new in completely different areas. Of the latter, these are courses Businessman In The Network, nurse courses and a lecture 5 Programming Languages That Every Developer Should Learn.

I drive car, but not very well so far. 

### Skills
I have knowledge on C++, C#, Windows Forms, ADO.NET, SQL (MS SQL Server). I have some git skills also. At the moment I study WPF, CSS, HTML and JavaScript
